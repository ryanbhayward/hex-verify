It would be possible to force a + node everywhere I guess
(but then I might as well switch it back to normal nodes being ANDs
and mark OR nodes with a dot).

In general the levels have no meang wrt to move number.  If pattern A
calls pattern B, that could be at the next level, or 15 moves later,
it would look the same in this tree.  But, in Yang's proof I guess it's
 aways the second level, since his patterns always immediately call
other patterns.

The line thing was bothering me too. 

I think stuff like this needs to be tweaked by hand -- if the 
tree is smaller then these settings work fine.  I think we need to find
a tree, get a reasonable format for it, then tweak it by hand until it looks
nice.  :)
