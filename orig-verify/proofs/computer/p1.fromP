This seems reasonable to me... the only other option is to show a subtree 
(i.e. root != pattern1) more fully

Good point... I didn't think of that.

Hmmm... the + makes options seem to be at different depths even though 
they're children of the same pattern... I think horizontal levels should 
correspond to move number... so perhaps forget about the and/or distinction? 
I'm not sure how to limit the depths otherwise...

The subtree/subpattern idea looks more appealing to me right now... I'm not 
sure - what's the purpose in the paper? To demonstrate a sample, or give an 
overview of Yang's proof?

One thing I noticed was that the lines sometimes obscure the text 
(especially for those lines at large angles). Perhaps if you try adding 
"linewidth=0pt" as one of the options (supposedly this gives the thinnest 
line possible, rather than "linestyle=none" which makes them invisible). Of 
course, if that's too thin to be visible, increment it or return to normal, 
but I think thinner lines might help a little.
[not sure if to do this need \psset{linewidth=0pt}, or just include it with 
treemode=R, etc.]

That's about it though... I don't have any other ideas at this hour :)
