In addition to the changes to Jing Yang's proof listed at the top of 7x7, 
it should also be noted that I never used patterns 2c and 2d... the reason 
is that pattern2d calls pattern2ab, and the only places 2d appeared was 
when the 2ab decision had already been made earlier... so 2d was really 
redundant.

Similarly, 2c appeared in cases like pattern 8, where the pattern calling 
2c doesn't realize that these two hexes are actually connected somehow... 
since that knowledge is only really available to its parent (very similar 
to 2d - the info/decision is at a higher level). So I just typed in the 
miai manually for these cases...

Examples of this are pattern8 (if we play e5, d6 and e4 join to c6 and d4, 
but c6 and d4 are connected by pattern2ab in a parent pattern) and pattern 
32b (playing b6 doesn't really invoke pattern 2d since a5-a6 are already 
miai)

Hope this makes sense!
