Ok, I've got something working.  

There are two types of pstricks output.
Use "--pstricks-trees" to output the proof tree for each pattern.
Use "--pstricks-calls" to output the pattern call tree for each pattern.
You can use none, either one, or both. 

The second command creates a 'patternname-calls.tex' file for each pattern.

When printing the pattern names I use only the suffix of the pattern
name starting with the first digit.  So "pattern32ab" is printed
as "32ab" and "foo34bar36moo" would be "34bar36moo".  
This seems to work decently well for the naming scheme we've been
using so far. 

The called patterns of a node are displayed in the order that Phil entered
them in that pattern. From the ones I looked at, it seems this is very 
close to what's in the paper.  Now we can see what the hell Yang was doing. :-P

The spacing can be an issue, so it may be necessary to go in and
change the spacing parameters by hand if the tree looks bad. 
Since we'll probably only use this for pattern1 this is 
a non-issue, I guess. :)

Do you mind if I do this tomorrow morning? :)

Sure.
