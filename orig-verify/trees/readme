I just commited some code to output patterns in pstricks format.

To try it on the supplied 4x4proof, do:

./hex < 4x4proof --pstricks

Each pattern gets a .tex file with its name.  In this case,
the single pattern in this file is called '4x4proof' so the output
should be in '4x4proof.tex'.  These files are overwritten without
warning so be careful. ;-)


I have the following header in the tex file:

"\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\small"

then the tree info follows. After that, there is:

"\caption{4x4proof}
\end{figure}"

I stick the pattern name into the caption.

Phil gave me an example tree with circles around the hex labels.
In the paper it looks like there are no circles.  I chose
the no circle option for the default, but if you want circles
use the command-line argument "--pstricks-circles" (in addition
to the "--pstricks" argument). 

I can easily add options to change the font size 
and turn off centering if these are wanted/needed.
I can also add options to change those pstricks options
that you guys set in the root node.  

A simple \input{pattern name} should be the only thing necessary
to include these trees in the paper.  

If you don't like anything, let me know. :)
