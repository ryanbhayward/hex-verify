Oh still cool! I've been drawing the same trees too; they apply to set 
colouring games in general (though a bit trickier is the game is not 
isotone). I hadn't automated them though.

(Typo in reference to figure "fp1.diag" just before the 
acknowledgements... Also, our "Hex and Combinatorics" has probably 
graduated to "to appear 2006" now (-; ).

So far I'm on a cycle of 2 weeks in California and 4 weeks in Norway. 
Right now I'm in CA, going back to Norway again this weekend, and back 
to CA again at the end of March. Quite a commute...

With the job it's been hard to get oriented while stranded out in 
Norway, 9 time zones away from my project team. But it's normal for new 
recruits to spend their first two months in total confusion anyway. The 
starter project is just to get you up to speed with how things work, and 
to give you an opportunity to look around and find projects that you'd 
*really* like to work on. I have definitely found one or two that sound 
very appealing to me.

Meanwhile, the work environment itself is beyond awesome. I'm SO glad I 
never got a job offer in Vancouver or elsewhere. The total value 
(financial plus otherwise) of this job is about 5 times higher than one 
at EA, and by that I literally mean that EA would have to increase its 
salaries by 400% to get me to even think about it.  (-:


Jack.
