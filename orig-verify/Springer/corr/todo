one more thing:
  stress test our method by running it on the
  Shannon-strategy for n(n-1) boards for largest possible n

output: 
  total number of nodes?

new option:
  remove and nodes and pattern calls
    (create an or-only tree; should have same
    number of leafs as number of paths in current version)

mention in paper
  that connection information in proof
  template is for *human debugging purposes* only;
  not needed unless we go to a dynamic programming version,
  which would run faster

Yang's proof actually had to be modified
  in a few places
  to conform to our proof format
  because it wasn't elusive
    (turned out that one of the
    patterns called could be replace
    by a smaller calling pattern)

future work:
  automated translation... a few small problems to overcome...

Oops, yeah... older version, so only 2+3 are actually there. Still, overall 
it reads quite nicely! (I would never have known it was so last-minute :)
