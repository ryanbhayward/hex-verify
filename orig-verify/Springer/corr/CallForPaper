Dear author of an accepted paper for the conference CG 2006, 

We are eager to meet you in Turin. You will find there your paper included in the degital procedings CD which will be immediately available.

We are happy to inform you that we successfully negotiated a post conference publication with Springer, probably in the high quality series LNAI. So we recommend that you attend the conference, take note of questions and comments, produce a post conference, revised version, and let us to review again your revised paper again.

Please be warned that for this Springer publication we will have to select only the best papers presented at the conference (say between one half and two thirds of the currently accepted ones: this is a request of the publisher).
 

Looking forward to seeing you in Turin,

 

Yours sincerely, 

on behalf of the Programme Committee
