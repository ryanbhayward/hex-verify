Subject: Your re-submission to the CG conference

Dear authors,

unfortunately we have to inform you that your re-submission on 17. May was after the deadlien for re-submissions. Since we started burning the conference CDs already we cannot include your re-submission.

Nonetheless, we are looking forward to meeting you in Turin.

Yours sincerely,

Jaap v.d. Herik
(Co-Chair of the Program Committee)
