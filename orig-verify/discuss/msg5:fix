The new proof is correct for a first move of b3. However, the problem is 
whether there are valid proofs that our current method will not accept.

Let's look at the old proof starting at d1 (sorry for the new notation - I 
just find this easier to mentally parse):
d1 -> | c3 -> | c2
                     | d2
                -> | b4
                     | c4
         | b3 -> | a4
                     | b4
                -> | c2
                     | b2 -> | b1
                                | c1
                     | d2 -> | c3
                           -> | d3 -> | c4
                                           | d4
        | d3 -> | c4
                   | d4
              -> | d2
                   | b3 -> | a4
                              | c3
                         -> | c2
                              | b2 -> | b1
                                         | c1

- The c3 branch obviously defeats all first opponent moves except for c3, 
c2, d2, b4, and c4.
- Of these moves, the b3 branch easily defeats d2, c3, and c4 via c2 or b2. 
Thus, the only problematic opponent moves remaining are c2 and b4. b3 cannot 
handle b4 because it must have one of a4/b4 and it's the opponent's turn 
next (so they can grab a4). If c2 was the opponent's first move, then any of 
b2, b1, and c1 cancel the b2 branch, leaving the d2 branch. The b3 -> d2 
branch works in this scenario, so the only problematic first move for the 
opponent is b4.
- Looking at the d1 -> d3 branch (recalling that opponent must have played 
b4 first), then d2 is forced, and so a4/c3 connects to one side. Hence c2 is 
forced for the opponent, and b2 completes the win.

So I agree this is a valid winning strategy, even though the intersection 
rule fails.

However, I am skeptical about the ability to `fix' this proof. For instance, 
d2 appears in the b3 branch in order to defeat c2. Meanwhile, d2 is easily 
defeated by the b3 -> c2/b2 branches. Thus, although it seems like the b3 
branch is susceptible to c2 and d2, it is not (there is kind of a 
circularity here...).

I think fixing proofs is highly problematic - as the proofs get more 
complicated, this will take longer (and may not always be possible..?) 
Essentially our problem is that our verifier is sound, but not complete.

The reason for this trouble, I think, is that by not specifying the 
opponent's moves, we've made the opponent's plays appear more variable than 
they really are. For instance, after d1, if the c3 branch does not work, 
then when we consider b3 we actually know that the opponent has played one 
of 5 moves. And if we need to consider b3 -> d4 (and I assume the branches 
are considered in vertical order), then we know that the opponent's first 
move had to be b4 (otherwise some other branch would have already 
succeeded).

Thus, I'm thinking we need to carry around a list of where the opponent 
could possibly be (for each of the moves they've made), based on the 
mustplay of previous branches. This certainly slows down and complicates our 
verifier (or requires additional information in our proof), but I do not 
think that fixing proofs is a reasonable option on larger boards.

I'll keep thinking though and see if I can come up with a better way for 
Monday...

Phil
