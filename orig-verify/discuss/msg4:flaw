I seem to have run into a problem doing the intersection.

Take a look at the 4x4 proof.  

The c2 node appears in the c3,b3, and d3 subtrees of the root. 
So do c3,c4 and d2.  This means the normal intersection test fails
at the root. 

We obviously need to do something different for the intersection
test then, don't we? 

1ps node: its children need to have an empty intersection because we
eventually need to play all of these sub strategies. 

2ps node: now what?  in the 4x4 proof, after player 1 plays d1 and
player 2 plays c2, player 1 can still win by going down the b3 subtree.
Same if player 2 players c3,c4 or d2 instead of c2.  So even though
the intersection fails, it's still a proof. 

..... 

(I postponed this email to think on it before sending)

Actually, we can remove the c2 node from the b3 subtree, can't we?

After player 1 has played d1 and b3, he's virtually connected
to the right side (unless player 2 played a4 or b4, but then p1
would play c3 instead of b3 as his second move).  But then we
can always play one of b2 or d2, so the c2 move is extra.  

I believe the proof can be re-structured for the c3,c4,and d2
cases as well.  Maybe we don't need to change how the verifier works,
maybe the proof can just be massaged into a slightly different
form?  :)  Ie, you gave me a bad proof.   ;-)

Actually, I'm pretty sure of this now.  If we explode the proof
into its OR form, wouldn't this new tree fail the elusive test?


Sorry this email is so sporadic, I've been writing it off and on
for the last 40min or so while I think about stuff. :)
